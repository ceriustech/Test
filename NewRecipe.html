<h1>Low and Slow</h1>
	<p>This week I am <i>extremely</i> excited about a new cooking technique called <b>sous vide</b>.In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) 
	into a water bath that is <br>precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book,<cite>Cooking for geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it
	as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</br></p>
	<p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p>
